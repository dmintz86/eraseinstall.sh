# eraseinstall.sh
This is a utility I have created to allow a mac admin to go into Jamf Self Service and initiate an Erase Install.

The utility also gives the admin the chance to provision the machine for the new user and have it build according to a set configuration. 

This is a workflow with a selection of individual policies. Please view the PDF document for this workflow so you can configure all the individual elements.
